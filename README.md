# Employee-Absenteeism-Prediction
## Finding factors in which contribute to inefficiency and absence in the workplace

I created this as a non-exclusive and open freelance project which analyzes anonymous, non-sensitive employee personal information in order to predict excessive absenteeism (~3 hours a day) from the company office during the workday. This was created for an HR department with the hopes of making it easier to find what various factors about the employees contributes to the strain on their work performance or personal stress, and how the company can become more efficient while improving employee health.

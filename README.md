# Employee-Absenteeism-Prediction
## Finding factors which contribute to inefficiency and absence in the workplace

This as a non-exclusive and open freelance project which analyzes provided anonymous, non-sensitive employee personal information in order to predict excessive absenteeism (~3 hours a day) from the company office during the workday (given permission to open-source). I created this for the cooresponding HR department with the hopes of making it easier to find what various factors about the employees contributes to the strain on their work performance or personal stress, and how the company can become more efficient while improving employee health.
